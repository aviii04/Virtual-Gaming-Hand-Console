# Virtual Gaming Hand Console (BE Project)
Usedd CNN to trained the model.It captures live feed from webcam and predict fingure gesture, which can be used to emulate/control i/o operations. In this case I am emulating key press event to control various game actions.

Preprocessed dataset to augment a variety of hand gesture by producing derivative, rotated, angled and zoomed images.
